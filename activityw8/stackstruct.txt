Hi, my name is daniel, I am building a stack. 
My stack must hold data in an ordered method, and it must consist of at least three functions:
push
pop
print.

Push adds a value to our stack, which "pushes" all the other values down one in our data structure.
Pop removes a value from the top of that stack, outputting it from our stack. 
"Print" is what I'm assuming the "peek" thingy, which lets us see what is on top of our plate stack, but does not take them away
