In activity 4_1, the assignment was to build three types of arrays and three types of vectors, and, using printf, print the first element from each of these. 
With this in mind, I began to dissect my components. 

I must define my terms:

Type: data is stored in a computer as electrical signals, which the computer reads and converts into one of two numbers. It is either a 1 or a 0, a true or a false;
it is either on, or it is off. These signals are then converted, using various codexes, into a different value; a value of a certain type. The common types of these values are:
numeric types, such as integers
character types, such as letters,
boolean types, which means data that is either true or false; conditionals.
set types, such as the subject of the assignment, arrays and vectors. There are others.
Array: arrays store data in an indexed order. Arrays have a size that is determined at creation. I am going to define vectors comparatively to arrays.
Vector: vectors store data in an indexed order. Vectors have a size that can change, growing bigger depending on the need of the program. (this is called mutability. -->
Arrays are immutable; meaning they do not change in size.)

Currently, I don't believe I undertstand


A) I must build an array. 
B) I must build an array of a different type.
C) I must build an array of a different type.

As for vectors,
A) I must build a vector.
B) I must build a vector of a different type.
C) I must build a vector of a different type.

Printing:
A) I must printf element 1 of array 1
B) I must printf element 1 of array 2
C) I must printf element 1 of array 3
D) I must printf element 1 of vector 1
E) I must printf element 1 of vector 2
F) I must printf element 1 of vector 3
